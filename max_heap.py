    # This method compares the item at the given index with its parent node and re-adjusts the tree if necessary.
    #
    # This method when called during `self.insert()` takes the newly added item and pushes it UP the tree until
    # the heap order property is successfully preserved in the tree.
    #
    # If the newly added item is very LARGE (in the case of a MAX Heap), we might have to swap it up several levels:
    # potentially all the way up until it hits the top.
    #
    # Here is where our wasted element [0] is important. Notice that we can compute the parent of any node via
    # integer division (aka floor division). The index of the current node divided by 2 (then rounded down) is the
    # index of the parent node!
    #
    # (<index of child_node>) // 2 = <index of parent_node>

    # Re-balance the tree by shifting the element at given index down the tree until storage order
    # property is preserved.

    # This method takes the node at the given index and first looks to see if that node has children. If it does,
    # we'll call our utility _find_max_child_index() function to find which child to examine.
    # After retrieving the proper child to compare, we'll look to see if the child is larger
    # than the parent. If so, we want to push the parent down the tree (because in a max-heap, larger nodes are
    # placed in higher levels). To achieve this: we'll swap the parent and child.
